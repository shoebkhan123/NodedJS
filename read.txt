There are many ways of talking about the theory of the
novel, and mine will consist in posing three questions: Why
are novels in prose; Why are they so often stories of adventures;
and, Why was there a European, but not a Chinese rise
of the novel in the course of the eighteenth century. Disparate as they
may sound, the questions have a common source in the guiding idea
of the collection The Novel: ‘to make the literary field longer, larger, and
deeper’: historically longer, geographically larger, and morphologically
deeper than those few classics of nineteenth-century Western European
‘realism’ that have dominated the recent theory of the novel (and my
own work).1
 What the questions have in common, then, is that they
all point to processes that loom large in the history of the novel, but
not in its theory. Here, I w

Let me begin from the opposite side, of verse. Verse, versus: there is a
pattern that turns around and comes back: there is a symmetry, and
symmetry always suggests permanence, that’s why monuments are
symmetrical. But prose is not symmetrical, and this immediately creates
a sense of im-permanence and irreversibility: prose, pro-vorsa: forwardlooking
(or front-facing, as in the Roman Dea Provorsa, goddess of easy
childbirth): the text has an orientation, it leans forwards, its meaning
‘depends on what lies ahead (the end of a sentence; the next event in the
plot)’, as Michal Ginsburg and Lorri Nandrea have put it.2
 ‘The knight
was defending himself so bravely that his assailers could not prevail’; ‘Let’s
withdraw a little, so that they will not recognize me’; ‘I don’t know that
knight, but he is so bravethat I would gladly give him my love’. I found these
passages in a half page of the prose Lancelot, easily, because consecutive
and final constructions—where meaning depends so much on what
lies ahead that a sentence literally falls into the following one—these
forward-looking arrangements are everywhere in prose, and allow it its
typical acceleration of narrative rhythm. And it’s not that verse ignores
the consecutive nexus while prose is nothing but that, of course; these
are just their ‘lines of least resistance’, to use Jakobson’s metaphor; it is
not a matter of essence, but of relative frequency—but style is always a
matter of relative frequency, and consecutiveness is a good starting point
for a stylistics of prose.
But there is a second possible starting point, which leads, not towards
narrativity, but towards complexity. It’s a point often made by studies
of dérimage, the thirteenth-century prosification of courtly romances
which was one of the great moments of decision, so to speak, between
verse and prose, and where one thing that kept happening, in the
transfer from one into the other, was that the number of subordinate

clauses—increased.3
 Which makes sense, a line of verse can to a certain
extent stand alone, and so it encourages independent clauses; prose is
continuous, it’s more of a construction, I don’t think it’s an accident
that the myth of ‘inspiration’ is so seldom evoked for prose: inspiration
is too instantaneous to make sense there, too much like a gift; and
prose is not a gift; it’s work: ‘productivity of the spirit’, Lukács called
it in the Theory of the Novel, and it’s the right expression: hypotaxis
is not only laborious—it requires foresight, memory, adequation of
means to ends—but truly productive: the outcome is more than the
sum of its parts, because subordination establishes a hierarchy among
clauses, meaning becomes articulated, aspects emerge that didn’t exist
before . . . That’s how complexity comes into being.
The acceleration of narrativity; the construction of complexity. Both
real: and totally at odds with each other. What did prose mean for the
novel . . . it allowed it to play on two completely different tables—popular
and cultivated—making it a uniquely adaptable and successful form. But,
also, an extremely polarized form. The theory of the novel should have
greater morphological depth, I said earlier, but depth is an understatement:
what we have here are stylistic extremes that in the course of two
thousand years not only drift further and further away from each other,
but turn against each other: the style of complexity, with its hypothetical,
concessive, and conditional clauses, making forward-looking narrative
seem hopelessly simple-minded and plebeian; and popular forms, for
their part, mutilating complexity wherever they find it—word, sentence,
paragraph, dialogue, everywhere.
A form divided between narrativity and complexity: with narrativity
dominating its history, and complexity its theory. And, yes, I understand
why someone would rather study sentence structure in The Ambassadors
than in its contemporary Dashing Diamond Dick. The problem is not the
value judgment, it’s that when a value judgment becomes the basis for
concepts, then it doesn’t just determine what is valued or not, but what is
thinkable or not, and in this case, what becomes unthinkable is, first, the
vast majority of the novelistic field, and, second, its very shape: because
polarization disappears if you only look at one of the extremes, whereas
it shouldn’t, because it’s the sign of how the novel participates in social
inequality, and duplicates it into cultural inequality. A theory of the
novel should account for this. But to do so, we need a new starting point.

‘Veblen explains culture in terms of kitsch, not vice-versa’, writes Adorno
in Prisms, disapprovingly:4
 but it’s such a tempting idea. Taking the style
of dime novels as the basic object of study, and explaining James’s as
an unlikely by-product: that’s how a theory of prose should proceed—
because that’s how history has proceeded. Not the other way around.
Looking at prose style from below . . . With digital databases, this is now
easy to imagine: a few years, and we’ll be able to search just about all
novels that have ever been published, and look for patterns among
billions of sentences. Personally, I am fascinated by this encounter of
the formal and the quantitative. Let me give you an example: all literary
scholars analyse stylistic structures—free indirect style, the stream
of consciousness, melodramatic excess, whatever. But it’s striking how
little we actually know about the genesis of these forms. Once they’re
there, we know what to do; but how did they get there in the first place?
How does the ‘confused thought’ (Michel Vovelle) of mentalité, which
is the substratum for almost all that happens in a culture—how does
messiness crystallize into the elegance of free indirect style? Concretely:
what are the steps? No one really knows. By sifting through thousands
of variations and permutations and approximations, a quantitative stylistics
of the digital archive may find some answers. It will be difficult,
no doubt, because one cannot study a large archive in the same way
one studies a text: texts are designed to ‘speak’ to us, and so, provided
we know how to listen, they always end up telling us something; but
archives are not messages that were meant to address us, and so they
say absolutely nothing until one asks the right question. And the trouble
is, we literary scholars are not good at that: we are trained to listen,
not to ask questions, and asking questions is the opposite of listening:
it turns criticism on its head, and transforms it into an experiment of
sorts: ‘questions put to nature’ is how experiments are often described,
and what I’m imagining here are questions—put to culture. Difficult;
but too interesting not to give it a try.

All this lies in the future. My second point lies in the past. Novels are
long; or rather, they span a very wide range of lengths—from the 20,000
words of Daphnis and Chloe to the 40,000 of Chrétien, 100,000 of
4

moretti: Novel Theory 115
Austen, 400,000 of Don Quixote, and over 800,000 of The Story of the
Stone—and one day it will be interesting to analyse the consequences of
this spectrum, but for now let’s just accept the simple notion that they
are long. The question is, How did they get to be that way, and there are
of course several answers, but if I had to choose a single mechanism
I would say: adventures.5
 Adventures expand novels by opening them
to the world: a call for help comes—the knight goes. Usually, without
asking questions; which is typical of adventure, the unknown is not a
threat here, it’s an opportunity, or more precisely: there is no longer any
distinction between threats and opportunities. ‘Who leaves the dangerous
path for the safe’, says Galessin, one of the knights of the Round
Table, ‘is not a knight, is a merchant’: true, capital doesn’t like danger for
its own sake, but a knight does: he has to: he can’t accumulate glory, he
must renew it all the time, so he needs this perpetual motion machine
of adventure . . .
. . . perpetual, especially if a border is in sight: across the bridge, into
the forest, up the mountain, through the gate, at sea. Adventures make
novels long because they make them wide; they are the great explorers of
the fictional world: battlefields, oceans, castles, sewers, prairies, islands,
slums, jungles, galaxies . . . Practically all great popular chronotopes have
arisen when the adventure plot has moved into a new geography, and
activated its narrative potential. Just as prose multiplies styles, then,
adventure multiplies stories: and forward-looking prose is perfect for
adventure, syntax and plot moving in unison, I’m not sure there is a
main branch in the family of forms we call the novel, but if there is one,
5
 If I had to choose a single mechanism . . . And if I could choose two: adventures—
and love. One mechanism to expand the story, and one to hold it together: a
conjunction that is particularly clear in the ancient novels, where love is the one
source of permanence in a world where everything else is scattered by fortune to
the four winds, and acts therefore as a figure for the social bond in general: the freely
chosen union from which, in antithesis to the adventures despotically imposed by
Tuche, a larger organism can somehow be glimpsed. But this balance between love
and adventure breaks down in chivalric romances, as errant knights start to actively
look for adventures (the Quest), and new figures for the social contract emerge (the
Court, the Round Table, the Grail). In this new situation, love becomes functionally
subordinated to adventure—and the theme of adultery, which immediately arises, is
at once the symptom of its abiding strength, and of its newly problematic position.
This redistribution of narrative tasks, from which love has never fully recovered, is
the reason why I decided to focus exclusively on adventures; besides, love has long
been recognized by the theory of the novel (especially in the English tradition), and
I wanted to shift our attention towards the historically broader phenomenon. 
116 nlr 52
it’s this: we would still recognize the history of the novel without modernism,
or even without realism;6 without adventures in prose, no.
Here, too, the novelistic field is profoundly polarized between adventures
and the everyday; and here, too, the theory of the novel has shown very
little interest (aside from Bakhtin, and now Pavel), for the popular side
of the field. But I won’t repeat that aspect of the argument, and will turn
instead to the odd narrowness that—in spite of all its plasticity—seems
typical of adventure. A social narrowness, fundamentally. The whole idea
had been ‘a creation of the petty nobility of penniless knights’, for whom
‘“aventure” was a way to survive—and possibly, to marry a heiress’, writes
Erich Köhler, who was the great sociologist of this convention.7
 But if
knights needed adventures, for other social classes the notion remained
opaque. ‘I am, as you see, a knight seeking what I cannot find,’ says
Calogrenant to a peasant at the beginning of Yvain: ‘And what do you
want to find?’ ‘Adventure, to test my courage and my strength. Now I
pray and beseech you to advise me, if you know, of any adventure or
wonder’. ‘I know nothing of adventure, nor have I ever heard about
it’ (ll. 356–67). What a reply; only a few years earlier, in the chanson de
geste, the nature of knightly action was clear to everybody; not any more.
Chivalric ethos has become ‘absolute . . . both in its ideal realization and
in the absence of any earthly and practical purpose’ writes Auerbach in
Mimesis: ‘no political function . . . no practical reality at all’. And yet, he
goes on, this unreal ethos ‘attained acceptance and validity in the real
world’ of Western culture for centuries to come.8
 How could it be?
For Köhler, the reason was that adventure became ‘stylized and moralized’
in the much wider ideal—launched by the Crusades, and sublimated by
the Grail—of ‘the Christian redemption of the warrior’.9 Which sounds
6 Hopefully, modernism (that is to say: the host of centrifugal experiments—Stein,
Kafka, Joyce, Pilniak, De Chirico, Platonov . . . —attempted in the years around
World War I) will play a larger role than realism in any future theory of the novel,
as a cluster of incompatible extremes should reveal something unique about what a
form can—and cannot—do. So far, however, this has not been the case.

right, but in its turn opens another problem: how could these starkly
feudal coordinates of adventure, not only survive into the bourgeois age,
but inspire all of its most popular genres?
III
Before I attempt an answer, some thoughts on the third question, the
Chinese–European comparison. Until well into the nineteenth century,
almost the end in fact, East Asian and West European novels developed
independently of each other; which is great, it’s like an experiment history
has run for us, the same form in two . . . laboratories, it’s perfect for
comparative morphology, because it allows us to look at formal features
not as givens, as we inevitably tend to do, but as choices: and choices that
eventually add up to alternative structures. Beginning, for instance, with
how often the protagonists of Chinese novels are, not individuals, but
groups: the household in the Jin Ping Mei and The Story of the Stone (or
Dream of the Red Chamber), the outlaws in The Water Margin, the literati
in The Scholars. Titles are already a clue—what would European titles
do without proper names—but here, not even one; and these are not
just random novels, they are four of the six ‘great masterpieces’ of the
Chinese canon, their titles (and their heroes) matter.
So, groups. Large; and with even larger character-systems around them:
Chinese critics have identified over 600 characters in The Scholars, 800
in The Water Margin and the Jin Ping Mei, 975 in The Story of the Stone.
And since size is seldom just size—a story with a thousand characters
is not like a story with fifty characters, only twenty times bigger: it’s a
different story—all this ends up generating a structure which is very
unlike the one we are used to in Europe. With so many variables, one
would expect it to be more unpredictable, but the opposite is actually
more often the case: a great attempt at reducing unpredictability, and
re-balancing the narrative system. Let me give you an example from
The Story of the Stone: after six or seven hundred pages, the two young
undeclared lovers, Bao-yu and Dai-yu, have one of their many fights;
Dai-yu leaves, and Bao-yu, left alone, falls into a sort of trance; his maid
Aroma arrives, but he doesn’t notice her, and in his dream-like state proceeds
to express for the first time his love for Dai-yu; then he ‘awakes’,
sees Aroma, is bewildered, runs away, and one can imagine all sorts of
sequels here: Aroma has been sleeping with Bao-yu for some time, and 
118 nlr 52
could feel wounded; or she could side with Dai-yu, and tell her what
Bao-yu has just said; or she could betray her to the other young woman
who is in love with Bao-yu . . . Many ways of making the episode generate
narrative (after all, we’ve been waiting for this declaration of love for
hundreds of pages); and instead, what Aroma immediately thinks is ‘how
she could arrange matters so as to prevent any scandal developing from
those words’. Preventing developments: that’s the key. Minimizing narrativity.
The Story of the Stone is often described as a Chinese Buddenbrooks,
and they are certainly both stories of the decline of a great family, but
Buddenbrooks covers a half century in five hundred pages, and Stone a
dozen years in two thousand pages: and it’s not just a matter of rhythm,
here (although that is obviously also the case), but of the hierarchy
between synchrony and diachrony: Stone has a ‘horizontal’ dominant,
where what really matters is not what lies ‘ahead’ of a given event, as
in ‘forward-looking’ European prose, but what lies ‘to the side’ of it: all
the vibrations that ripple across this immense narrative system—and
all the counter-vibrations that try to keep it stable. Earlier, I pointed out
how the breakdown of symmetry allowed European prose to intensify
irreversibility; irreversibility is present also in Chinese novels, of course,
but instead of intensifying it they often try to contain it, and so symmetry
regains its centrality: chapters are announced by couplets that neatly
divide them into two halves; many important passages are couched in
the wonderfully named ‘parallel prose’ (‘Every evening devoted to the
pursuit of pleasure; Every morning an occasion for deluded dalliance’);
in the novel’s overall architecture there are blocks of ten, twenty, even
fifty chapters that mirror each other across hundreds of pages . . . It’s
really an alternative tradition.
Alternative, but comparable: up to the eighteenth century, the Chinese
novel was arguably greater in both quantity and quality than any in
Europe, with the possible exception of France. ‘The Chinese have novels
by the thousand, and already had them when our ancestors were living
in the forests’, said Goethe to Eckermann in 1827, on the day he coined
the concept of Weltliteratur (while reading a Chinese novel). But the figures
are wrong: by 1827 novels by the thousand existed in France, or
Britain, or indeed in Germany—but not in China.
Why?

IV
When we discuss the destinies of eighteenth-century core areas, writes
Kenneth Pomeranz in The Great Divergence,
we should make our comparisons . . . truly reciprocal . . . that is, look for
absences, accidents and obstacles that diverted England from a path that
might have made it more like the Yangzi Delta or Gujarat, along with the
more usual exercise of looking for blockages that kept non-European areas
from reproducing implicitly normalized European paths . . . view both sides
of the comparison as ‘deviations’ when seen through the expectations of the
other, rather than leaving one as always the norm.10
The European rise of the novel as a deviation from the Chinese path: as
soon as you start thinking in these terms, it immediately leaps to the eye
how much more seriously the novel was taken in China than in Europe.
Despite all the attacks by the Confucian literati, by the early seventeenth
century Chinese culture already had a novelistic canon; Europe wasn’t
even thinking about it. For the epic or tragedy it had one, or the lyric;
not for the novel. And the canon is just the tip of the iceberg: there was
in China an immense investment of intellectual energies in the edition,
revision, continuation, and especially commentary of novels. These were
already very long books, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, 600,000
words, the inter-lineal commentary made it almost a million—but it
added so much ‘to the enjoyment . . . of the novel’, writes David Rolston,
‘that editions without commentary . . . went out of circulation’.11
‘The novel has less need of . . . commentary than other genres’, writes
Watt in The Rise of the Novel,
12 and for Europe he’s right. But Chinese novels
needed them, because they were seen as—art. Since at least the Jin
Ping Mei, around 1600, ‘Chinese xiaoshuo went through an . . . extended
aesthetic turn’, writes Ming Dong Gu: ‘a self-conscious emulation and
competition with the dominant literary genres . . . a poeticization’.13 We
should look for absences that diverted the European novel from the
Chinese path . . . and here is one: the aesthetic turn of the European

novel occurred in the late nineteenth century, with a delay of almost
three hundred years.14
Why?
V
For Pomeranz, one reason for the great divergence was that in eighteenthcentury
Europe ‘the wheels of fashion were spinning faster’,15 stimulating
consumption, and through it the economy as a whole; while in China,
after the consolidation of the Qing dynasty, consumption ‘as a motor
of change’ came to a halt for over a century, not triggering that ‘consumer
revolution’ McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb have written about.
Revolution is a big word, and many have questioned the extent of consumption
before the mid-nineteenth-century; still, no one really doubts
that ‘superfluous things’, to use a Chinese expression, multiplied during
the eighteenth century, from interior decoration to mirrors, clocks, porcelain,
silverware, jewelry—and concerts, journeys and books. ‘In any
consideration of leisure’, writes Plumb, ‘it would be quite wrong not to
put cultural pursuits in the foreground’.16 So: what did ‘the birth of a
consumer society’ mean for the European novel?
14 The divergence of the two models is well illustrated by the role played by Don
Quixote and the Jin Ping Mei—two novels that were written in the same years, and
are often compared to each other (more by sinologists than by hispanists, it must
be said)—in their respective traditions: for at least two centuries, if not longer, the
Jin Ping Mei’s influence on the theory and practice of the novel in China was incomparably
greater than that of Don Quixote in Europe. A similar parting of the ways
occurs in the late eighteenth century, when the peak of the Chinese aesthetic turn
(The Story of the Stone) could have found its match in an incredibly gifted generation
of German poet-novelists (Goethe, Hölderlin, Novalis, Schlegel, Von Arnim,
Brentano)—if only they hadn’t been roundly ignored by European readers (except
for Goethe, of course; but even Goethe kept the ‘poetic’ first version of Meister in a
drawer, as if sensing that it wasn’t the right book for the times). Incidentally, that
the Jin Ping Mei could be hailed as the masterpiece that would change the Chinese
novel is another striking instance of the difference between the two traditions: that
European culture could produce—and appreciate!—an erotic corpus as explicit as
the Chinese one is quite unimaginable.

Commercialization of Eighteenth-Century England, Bloomington 1982, pp. 265–6.
moretti: Novel Theory 121
First of all, a giant quantitative leap. From the first to the last decade of
the century, new titles increased seven times in France (even though,
in the 1790s, the French had more to do than write novels); fourteen in
Britain; and about thirty in the German territories. Also, by the end of
the eighteenth century print runs had become a little larger, especially
for reprints; many novels that are not included in the standard bibliographies
were published in magazines (some of which had a very wide
audience); the strengthening of family ties encouraged reading aloud at
home (providing the training ground for Dr. Bowdler’s vocation); finally,
and most significantly, the diffusion of lending libraries made novels
circulate much more efficiently than before, eventually leading to the
imposition of the three-decker on writers and publishers alike, so as to
lend each novel to three readers at once. Hard though it is to quantify
these various factors, if all of them combined increased the circulation of
novels between two and three times (a conservative estimate), then the
presence of novels in Western Europe would have gone up between thirty
and sixty times in the course of the eighteenth century. For McKendrick,
the fact that consumption of tea rose fifteenfold in a hundred years is
a great success story of the consumer revolution. Novels, increased
more than tea.
Why? The answer used to be, Because readers did. But the current
consensus—which is slippery, like all that has to do with literacy, but
has been stable for a few decades now—is that between 1700 and 1800,
readers doubled; a little less than that in France, a little more in England,
but that’s the horizon. They doubled; they didn’t increase fifty times.
But, they were reading differently. ‘Extensive’ reading, Rolf Engelsing has
called it: reading a lot more than in the past, avidly, at times passionately,
but probably more often than not also superficially, quickly, even
a little erratically; quite different from the ‘intensive’ reading and rereading
of the same few books—usually devotional ones—that had been
the norm until then.17 And Engelsing’s thesis has often been criticized,
but with novels multiplying so much more quickly than readers, and
readers behaving like the famous John Latimer, of Warwick, who from
mid-January to mid-February 1771 borrowed a volume a day from Clay’s
circulating library,18 it is hard to imagine how the whole process could
have worked without a major increase in—let’s call it distraction.

Stuttgart 1974, esp. pp. 182ff.
18 Jan Fergus, Provincial Readers in Eighteenth-Century England, Oxford 2006, p. 113.
122 nlr 52
Let’s call it that, because, even though Engelsing never mentions
Benjamin, extensive reading looks very much like an early version of
that ‘perception in a state of distraction’ described at the end of ‘The
Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’. Distraction
in that essay is Zerstreuung—absent-mindedness, and entertainment: the
perfect mix for novel-reading—and for Benjamin it is the attitude that
becomes necessary at those ‘historical turning points’ when the ‘tasks’
facing ‘the human apparatus of perception’ are so overwhelming that
they can’t be ‘mastered’ by way of concentrated attention:19 and distraction
emerges as the best way to cope with the new situation—to keep up
with those ‘faster-spinning wheels of fashion’ that have so dramatically
widened the market for novels.20
19 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’,
1935, in Selected Writings iii: 1935–1938, Cambridge, ma 2002, p. 119. The passage
returns virtually unchanged in the third version of the essay, in 1939.
20 As I hope is clear, my focus on consumption, fashion and distraction is not meant
to erase capitalism from literary history, but to specify which of its aspects play a
more direct causal role in the novel’s take-off. Unquestionably, capitalist expansion
as such created some key general pre-conditions: a larger, more literate population;
more disposable income; and more free time (for some). But since new novelistic
titles increased four times faster than printed matter in general during the eighteenth
century (even including the flood of pamphlets at the end of the century: see
James Raven, The Business of Books. Booksellers and the English Book Trade 1450–1850,
New Haven, cn 2007, p. 8), we must also explain this different rate of growth:
and that peculiar exaggeration of consumer mentality embodied by distraction and
fashion (and which seems to play a lesser role for drama, poetry, and most other
types of cultural production), seems to be the best explanation we have found so far.
That consumption could play such a large role in the history of the novel depends,
in its turn, on the fact that the suspicion towards reading for pleasure was beginning
to fade, in line with Constant’s idea of the Liberty of the Moderns as ‘the
enjoyment of security in private pleasures’ (Benjamin Constant, Political Writings,
Cambridge 2007, p. 317). Pleasure, by the way, is another blindspot of the theory of
the novel: though we ‘know’, more or less, that the novel was from the very beginning
a form of ‘light reading’ (Thomas Hägg, ‘Orality, literacy, and the “readership”
of the early Greek novel’, in R. Eriksen, ed., Contexts of Pre-Novel Narrative, Berlin
and New York 1994, p. 51), we still work as if reading for pleasure were basically
the same as reading ‘for serious reasons—religious, economic, or social’ (J. Paul
Hunter, Before Novels. The Cultural Contexts of Eighteenth Century English Fiction,
New York and London, 1990, p. 84: one of the few to pose the problem in an interesting
way). This is yet another issue on which specific historical studies are well
ahead of theoretical reflection: the dramatic enlargement of the ancient novelistic
field, for instance, would have been impossible without a shift towards popular,
light, and even vulgar forms of writing. 
There are many ways of talking about the theory of the
novel, and mine will consist in posing three questions: Why
are novels in prose; Why are they so often stories of adventures;
and, Why was there a European, but not a Chinese rise
of the novel in the course of the eighteenth century. Disparate as they
may sound, the questions have a common source in the guiding idea
of the collection The Novel: ‘to make the literary field longer, larger, and
deeper’: historically longer, geographically larger, and morphologically
deeper than those few classics of nineteenth-century Western European
‘realism’ that have dominated the recent theory of the novel (and my
own work).1
 What the questions have in common, then, is that they
all point to processes that loom large in the history of the novel, but
not in its theory. Here, I w

Let me begin from the opposite side, of verse. Verse, versus: there is a
pattern that turns around and comes back: there is a symmetry, and
symmetry always suggests permanence, that’s why monuments are
symmetrical. But prose is not symmetrical, and this immediately creates
a sense of im-permanence and irreversibility: prose, pro-vorsa: forwardlooking
(or front-facing, as in the Roman Dea Provorsa, goddess of easy
childbirth): the text has an orientation, it leans forwards, its meaning
‘depends on what lies ahead (the end of a sentence; the next event in the
plot)’, as Michal Ginsburg and Lorri Nandrea have put it.2
 ‘The knight
was defending himself so bravely that his assailers could not prevail’; ‘Let’s
withdraw a little, so that they will not recognize me’; ‘I don’t know that
knight, but he is so bravethat I would gladly give him my love’. I found these
passages in a half page of the prose Lancelot, easily, because consecutive
and final constructions—where meaning depends so much on what
lies ahead that a sentence literally falls into the following one—these
forward-looking arrangements are everywhere in prose, and allow it its
typical acceleration of narrative rhythm. And it’s not that verse ignores
the consecutive nexus while prose is nothing but that, of course; these
are just their ‘lines of least resistance’, to use Jakobson’s metaphor; it is
not a matter of essence, but of relative frequency—but style is always a
matter of relative frequency, and consecutiveness is a good starting point
for a stylistics of prose.
But there is a second possible starting point, which leads, not towards
narrativity, but towards complexity. It’s a point often made by studies
of dérimage, the thirteenth-century prosification of courtly romances
which was one of the great moments of decision, so to speak, between
verse and prose, and where one thing that kept happening, in the
transfer from one into the other, was that the number of subordinate

clauses—increased.3
 Which makes sense, a line of verse can to a certain
extent stand alone, and so it encourages independent clauses; prose is
continuous, it’s more of a construction, I don’t think it’s an accident
that the myth of ‘inspiration’ is so seldom evoked for prose: inspiration
is too instantaneous to make sense there, too much like a gift; and
prose is not a gift; it’s work: ‘productivity of the spirit’, Lukács called
it in the Theory of the Novel, and it’s the right expression: hypotaxis
is not only laborious—it requires foresight, memory, adequation of
means to ends—but truly productive: the outcome is more than the
sum of its parts, because subordination establishes a hierarchy among
clauses, meaning becomes articulated, aspects emerge that didn’t exist
before . . . That’s how complexity comes into being.
The acceleration of narrativity; the construction of complexity. Both
real: and totally at odds with each other. What did prose mean for the
novel . . . it allowed it to play on two completely different tables—popular
and cultivated—making it a uniquely adaptable and successful form. But,
also, an extremely polarized form. The theory of the novel should have
greater morphological depth, I said earlier, but depth is an understatement:
what we have here are stylistic extremes that in the course of two
thousand years not only drift further and further away from each other,
but turn against each other: the style of complexity, with its hypothetical,
concessive, and conditional clauses, making forward-looking narrative
seem hopelessly simple-minded and plebeian; and popular forms, for
their part, mutilating complexity wherever they find it—word, sentence,
paragraph, dialogue, everywhere.
A form divided between narrativity and complexity: with narrativity
dominating its history, and complexity its theory. And, yes, I understand
why someone would rather study sentence structure in The Ambassadors
than in its contemporary Dashing Diamond Dick. The problem is not the
value judgment, it’s that when a value judgment becomes the basis for
concepts, then it doesn’t just determine what is valued or not, but what is
thinkable or not, and in this case, what becomes unthinkable is, first, the
vast majority of the novelistic field, and, second, its very shape: because
polarization disappears if you only look at one of the extremes, whereas
it shouldn’t, because it’s the sign of how the novel participates in social
inequality, and duplicates it into cultural inequality. A theory of the
novel should account for this. But to do so, we need a new starting point.

‘Veblen explains culture in terms of kitsch, not vice-versa’, writes Adorno
in Prisms, disapprovingly:4
 but it’s such a tempting idea. Taking the style
of dime novels as the basic object of study, and explaining James’s as
an unlikely by-product: that’s how a theory of prose should proceed—
because that’s how history has proceeded. Not the other way around.
Looking at prose style from below . . . With digital databases, this is now
easy to imagine: a few years, and we’ll be able to search just about all
novels that have ever been published, and look for patterns among
billions of sentences. Personally, I am fascinated by this encounter of
the formal and the quantitative. Let me give you an example: all literary
scholars analyse stylistic structures—free indirect style, the stream
of consciousness, melodramatic excess, whatever. But it’s striking how
little we actually know about the genesis of these forms. Once they’re
there, we know what to do; but how did they get there in the first place?
How does the ‘confused thought’ (Michel Vovelle) of mentalité, which
is the substratum for almost all that happens in a culture—how does
messiness crystallize into the elegance of free indirect style? Concretely:
what are the steps? No one really knows. By sifting through thousands
of variations and permutations and approximations, a quantitative stylistics
of the digital archive may find some answers. It will be difficult,
no doubt, because one cannot study a large archive in the same way
one studies a text: texts are designed to ‘speak’ to us, and so, provided
we know how to listen, they always end up telling us something; but
archives are not messages that were meant to address us, and so they
say absolutely nothing until one asks the right question. And the trouble
is, we literary scholars are not good at that: we are trained to listen,
not to ask questions, and asking questions is the opposite of listening:
it turns criticism on its head, and transforms it into an experiment of
sorts: ‘questions put to nature’ is how experiments are often described,
and what I’m imagining here are questions—put to culture. Difficult;
but too interesting not to give it a try.

All this lies in the future. My second point lies in the past. Novels are
long; or rather, they span a very wide range of lengths—from the 20,000
words of Daphnis and Chloe to the 40,000 of Chrétien, 100,000 of
4

moretti: Novel Theory 115
Austen, 400,000 of Don Quixote, and over 800,000 of The Story of the
Stone—and one day it will be interesting to analyse the consequences of
this spectrum, but for now let’s just accept the simple notion that they
are long. The question is, How did they get to be that way, and there are
of course several answers, but if I had to choose a single mechanism
I would say: adventures.5
 Adventures expand novels by opening them
to the world: a call for help comes—the knight goes. Usually, without
asking questions; which is typical of adventure, the unknown is not a
threat here, it’s an opportunity, or more precisely: there is no longer any
distinction between threats and opportunities. ‘Who leaves the dangerous
path for the safe’, says Galessin, one of the knights of the Round
Table, ‘is not a knight, is a merchant’: true, capital doesn’t like danger for
its own sake, but a knight does: he has to: he can’t accumulate glory, he
must renew it all the time, so he needs this perpetual motion machine
of adventure . . .
. . . perpetual, especially if a border is in sight: across the bridge, into
the forest, up the mountain, through the gate, at sea. Adventures make
novels long because they make them wide; they are the great explorers of
the fictional world: battlefields, oceans, castles, sewers, prairies, islands,
slums, jungles, galaxies . . . Practically all great popular chronotopes have
arisen when the adventure plot has moved into a new geography, and
activated its narrative potential. Just as prose multiplies styles, then,
adventure multiplies stories: and forward-looking prose is perfect for
adventure, syntax and plot moving in unison, I’m not sure there is a
main branch in the family of forms we call the novel, but if there is one,
5
 If I had to choose a single mechanism . . . And if I could choose two: adventures—
and love. One mechanism to expand the story, and one to hold it together: a
conjunction that is particularly clear in the ancient novels, where love is the one
source of permanence in a world where everything else is scattered by fortune to
the four winds, and acts therefore as a figure for the social bond in general: the freely
chosen union from which, in antithesis to the adventures despotically imposed by
Tuche, a larger organism can somehow be glimpsed. But this balance between love
and adventure breaks down in chivalric romances, as errant knights start to actively
look for adventures (the Quest), and new figures for the social contract emerge (the
Court, the Round Table, the Grail). In this new situation, love becomes functionally
subordinated to adventure—and the theme of adultery, which immediately arises, is
at once the symptom of its abiding strength, and of its newly problematic position.
This redistribution of narrative tasks, from which love has never fully recovered, is
the reason why I decided to focus exclusively on adventures; besides, love has long
been recognized by the theory of the novel (especially in the English tradition), and
I wanted to shift our attention towards the historically broader phenomenon. 
116 nlr 52
it’s this: we would still recognize the history of the novel without modernism,
or even without realism;6 without adventures in prose, no.
Here, too, the novelistic field is profoundly polarized between adventures
and the everyday; and here, too, the theory of the novel has shown very
little interest (aside from Bakhtin, and now Pavel), for the popular side
of the field. But I won’t repeat that aspect of the argument, and will turn
instead to the odd narrowness that—in spite of all its plasticity—seems
typical of adventure. A social narrowness, fundamentally. The whole idea
had been ‘a creation of the petty nobility of penniless knights’, for whom
‘“aventure” was a way to survive—and possibly, to marry a heiress’, writes
Erich Köhler, who was the great sociologist of this convention.7
 But if
knights needed adventures, for other social classes the notion remained
opaque. ‘I am, as you see, a knight seeking what I cannot find,’ says
Calogrenant to a peasant at the beginning of Yvain: ‘And what do you
want to find?’ ‘Adventure, to test my courage and my strength. Now I
pray and beseech you to advise me, if you know, of any adventure or
wonder’. ‘I know nothing of adventure, nor have I ever heard about
it’ (ll. 356–67). What a reply; only a few years earlier, in the chanson de
geste, the nature of knightly action was clear to everybody; not any more.
Chivalric ethos has become ‘absolute . . . both in its ideal realization and
in the absence of any earthly and practical purpose’ writes Auerbach in
Mimesis: ‘no political function . . . no practical reality at all’. And yet, he
goes on, this unreal ethos ‘attained acceptance and validity in the real
world’ of Western culture for centuries to come.8
 How could it be?
For Köhler, the reason was that adventure became ‘stylized and moralized’
in the much wider ideal—launched by the Crusades, and sublimated by
the Grail—of ‘the Christian redemption of the warrior’.9 Which sounds
6 Hopefully, modernism (that is to say: the host of centrifugal experiments—Stein,
Kafka, Joyce, Pilniak, De Chirico, Platonov . . . —attempted in the years around
World War I) will play a larger role than realism in any future theory of the novel,
as a cluster of incompatible extremes should reveal something unique about what a
form can—and cannot—do. So far, however, this has not been the case.

right, but in its turn opens another problem: how could these starkly
feudal coordinates of adventure, not only survive into the bourgeois age,
but inspire all of its most popular genres?
III
Before I attempt an answer, some thoughts on the third question, the
Chinese–European comparison. Until well into the nineteenth century,
almost the end in fact, East Asian and West European novels developed
independently of each other; which is great, it’s like an experiment history
has run for us, the same form in two . . . laboratories, it’s perfect for
comparative morphology, because it allows us to look at formal features
not as givens, as we inevitably tend to do, but as choices: and choices that
eventually add up to alternative structures. Beginning, for instance, with
how often the protagonists of Chinese novels are, not individuals, but
groups: the household in the Jin Ping Mei and The Story of the Stone (or
Dream of the Red Chamber), the outlaws in The Water Margin, the literati
in The Scholars. Titles are already a clue—what would European titles
do without proper names—but here, not even one; and these are not
just random novels, they are four of the six ‘great masterpieces’ of the
Chinese canon, their titles (and their heroes) matter.
So, groups. Large; and with even larger character-systems around them:
Chinese critics have identified over 600 characters in The Scholars, 800
in The Water Margin and the Jin Ping Mei, 975 in The Story of the Stone.
And since size is seldom just size—a story with a thousand characters
is not like a story with fifty characters, only twenty times bigger: it’s a
different story—all this ends up generating a structure which is very
unlike the one we are used to in Europe. With so many variables, one
would expect it to be more unpredictable, but the opposite is actually
more often the case: a great attempt at reducing unpredictability, and
re-balancing the narrative system. Let me give you an example from
The Story of the Stone: after six or seven hundred pages, the two young
undeclared lovers, Bao-yu and Dai-yu, have one of their many fights;
Dai-yu leaves, and Bao-yu, left alone, falls into a sort of trance; his maid
Aroma arrives, but he doesn’t notice her, and in his dream-like state proceeds
to express for the first time his love for Dai-yu; then he ‘awakes’,
sees Aroma, is bewildered, runs away, and one can imagine all sorts of
sequels here: Aroma has been sleeping with Bao-yu for some time, and 
118 nlr 52
could feel wounded; or she could side with Dai-yu, and tell her what
Bao-yu has just said; or she could betray her to the other young woman
who is in love with Bao-yu . . . Many ways of making the episode generate
narrative (after all, we’ve been waiting for this declaration of love for
hundreds of pages); and instead, what Aroma immediately thinks is ‘how
she could arrange matters so as to prevent any scandal developing from
those words’. Preventing developments: that’s the key. Minimizing narrativity.
The Story of the Stone is often described as a Chinese Buddenbrooks,
and they are certainly both stories of the decline of a great family, but
Buddenbrooks covers a half century in five hundred pages, and Stone a
dozen years in two thousand pages: and it’s not just a matter of rhythm,
here (although that is obviously also the case), but of the hierarchy
between synchrony and diachrony: Stone has a ‘horizontal’ dominant,
where what really matters is not what lies ‘ahead’ of a given event, as
in ‘forward-looking’ European prose, but what lies ‘to the side’ of it: all
the vibrations that ripple across this immense narrative system—and
all the counter-vibrations that try to keep it stable. Earlier, I pointed out
how the breakdown of symmetry allowed European prose to intensify
irreversibility; irreversibility is present also in Chinese novels, of course,
but instead of intensifying it they often try to contain it, and so symmetry
regains its centrality: chapters are announced by couplets that neatly
divide them into two halves; many important passages are couched in
the wonderfully named ‘parallel prose’ (‘Every evening devoted to the
pursuit of pleasure; Every morning an occasion for deluded dalliance’);
in the novel’s overall architecture there are blocks of ten, twenty, even
fifty chapters that mirror each other across hundreds of pages . . . It’s
really an alternative tradition.
Alternative, but comparable: up to the eighteenth century, the Chinese
novel was arguably greater in both quantity and quality than any in
Europe, with the possible exception of France. ‘The Chinese have novels
by the thousand, and already had them when our ancestors were living
in the forests’, said Goethe to Eckermann in 1827, on the day he coined
the concept of Weltliteratur (while reading a Chinese novel). But the figures
are wrong: by 1827 novels by the thousand existed in France, or
Britain, or indeed in Germany—but not in China.
Why?

IV
When we discuss the destinies of eighteenth-century core areas, writes
Kenneth Pomeranz in The Great Divergence,
we should make our comparisons . . . truly reciprocal . . . that is, look for
absences, accidents and obstacles that diverted England from a path that
might have made it more like the Yangzi Delta or Gujarat, along with the
more usual exercise of looking for blockages that kept non-European areas
from reproducing implicitly normalized European paths . . . view both sides
of the comparison as ‘deviations’ when seen through the expectations of the
other, rather than leaving one as always the norm.10
The European rise of the novel as a deviation from the Chinese path: as
soon as you start thinking in these terms, it immediately leaps to the eye
how much more seriously the novel was taken in China than in Europe.
Despite all the attacks by the Confucian literati, by the early seventeenth
century Chinese culture already had a novelistic canon; Europe wasn’t
even thinking about it. For the epic or tragedy it had one, or the lyric;
not for the novel. And the canon is just the tip of the iceberg: there was
in China an immense investment of intellectual energies in the edition,
revision, continuation, and especially commentary of novels. These were
already very long books, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, 600,000
words, the inter-lineal commentary made it almost a million—but it
added so much ‘to the enjoyment . . . of the novel’, writes David Rolston,
‘that editions without commentary . . . went out of circulation’.11
‘The novel has less need of . . . commentary than other genres’, writes
Watt in The Rise of the Novel,
12 and for Europe he’s right. But Chinese novels
needed them, because they were seen as—art. Since at least the Jin
Ping Mei, around 1600, ‘Chinese xiaoshuo went through an . . . extended
aesthetic turn’, writes Ming Dong Gu: ‘a self-conscious emulation and
competition with the dominant literary genres . . . a poeticization’.13 We
should look for absences that diverted the European novel from the
Chinese path . . . and here is one: the aesthetic turn of the European

novel occurred in the late nineteenth century, with a delay of almost
three hundred years.14
Why?
V
For Pomeranz, one reason for the great divergence was that in eighteenthcentury
Europe ‘the wheels of fashion were spinning faster’,15 stimulating
consumption, and through it the economy as a whole; while in China,
after the consolidation of the Qing dynasty, consumption ‘as a motor
of change’ came to a halt for over a century, not triggering that ‘consumer
revolution’ McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb have written about.
Revolution is a big word, and many have questioned the extent of consumption
before the mid-nineteenth-century; still, no one really doubts
that ‘superfluous things’, to use a Chinese expression, multiplied during
the eighteenth century, from interior decoration to mirrors, clocks, porcelain,
silverware, jewelry—and concerts, journeys and books. ‘In any
consideration of leisure’, writes Plumb, ‘it would be quite wrong not to
put cultural pursuits in the foreground’.16 So: what did ‘the birth of a
consumer society’ mean for the European novel?
14 The divergence of the two models is well illustrated by the role played by Don
Quixote and the Jin Ping Mei—two novels that were written in the same years, and
are often compared to each other (more by sinologists than by hispanists, it must
be said)—in their respective traditions: for at least two centuries, if not longer, the
Jin Ping Mei’s influence on the theory and practice of the novel in China was incomparably
greater than that of Don Quixote in Europe. A similar parting of the ways
occurs in the late eighteenth century, when the peak of the Chinese aesthetic turn
(The Story of the Stone) could have found its match in an incredibly gifted generation
of German poet-novelists (Goethe, Hölderlin, Novalis, Schlegel, Von Arnim,
Brentano)—if only they hadn’t been roundly ignored by European readers (except
for Goethe, of course; but even Goethe kept the ‘poetic’ first version of Meister in a
drawer, as if sensing that it wasn’t the right book for the times). Incidentally, that
the Jin Ping Mei could be hailed as the masterpiece that would change the Chinese
novel is another striking instance of the difference between the two traditions: that
European culture could produce—and appreciate!—an erotic corpus as explicit as
the Chinese one is quite unimaginable.

Commercialization of Eighteenth-Century England, Bloomington 1982, pp. 265–6.
moretti: Novel Theory 121
First of all, a giant quantitative leap. From the first to the last decade of
the century, new titles increased seven times in France (even though,
in the 1790s, the French had more to do than write novels); fourteen in
Britain; and about thirty in the German territories. Also, by the end of
the eighteenth century print runs had become a little larger, especially
for reprints; many novels that are not included in the standard bibliographies
were published in magazines (some of which had a very wide
audience); the strengthening of family ties encouraged reading aloud at
home (providing the training ground for Dr. Bowdler’s vocation); finally,
and most significantly, the diffusion of lending libraries made novels
circulate much more efficiently than before, eventually leading to the
imposition of the three-decker on writers and publishers alike, so as to
lend each novel to three readers at once. Hard though it is to quantify
these various factors, if all of them combined increased the circulation of
novels between two and three times (a conservative estimate), then the
presence of novels in Western Europe would have gone up between thirty
and sixty times in the course of the eighteenth century. For McKendrick,
the fact that consumption of tea rose fifteenfold in a hundred years is
a great success story of the consumer revolution. Novels, increased
more than tea.
Why? The answer used to be, Because readers did. But the current
consensus—which is slippery, like all that has to do with literacy, but
has been stable for a few decades now—is that between 1700 and 1800,
readers doubled; a little less than that in France, a little more in England,
but that’s the horizon. They doubled; they didn’t increase fifty times.
But, they were reading differently. ‘Extensive’ reading, Rolf Engelsing has
called it: reading a lot more than in the past, avidly, at times passionately,
but probably more often than not also superficially, quickly, even
a little erratically; quite different from the ‘intensive’ reading and rereading
of the same few books—usually devotional ones—that had been
the norm until then.17 And Engelsing’s thesis has often been criticized,
but with novels multiplying so much more quickly than readers, and
readers behaving like the famous John Latimer, of Warwick, who from
mid-January to mid-February 1771 borrowed a volume a day from Clay’s
circulating library,18 it is hard to imagine how the whole process could
have worked without a major increase in—let’s call it distraction.

Stuttgart 1974, esp. pp. 182ff.
18 Jan Fergus, Provincial Readers in Eighteenth-Century England, Oxford 2006, p. 113.
122 nlr 52
Let’s call it that, because, even though Engelsing never mentions
Benjamin, extensive reading looks very much like an early version of
that ‘perception in a state of distraction’ described at the end of ‘The
Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’. Distraction
in that essay is Zerstreuung—absent-mindedness, and entertainment: the
perfect mix for novel-reading—and for Benjamin it is the attitude that
becomes necessary at those ‘historical turning points’ when the ‘tasks’
facing ‘the human apparatus of perception’ are so overwhelming that
they can’t be ‘mastered’ by way of concentrated attention:19 and distraction
emerges as the best way to cope with the new situation—to keep up
with those ‘faster-spinning wheels of fashion’ that have so dramatically
widened the market for novels.20
19 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’,
1935, in Selected Writings iii: 1935–1938, Cambridge, ma 2002, p. 119. The passage
returns virtually unchanged in the third version of the essay, in 1939.
20 As I hope is clear, my focus on consumption, fashion and distraction is not meant
to erase capitalism from literary history, but to specify which of its aspects play a
more direct causal role in the novel’s take-off. Unquestionably, capitalist expansion
as such created some key general pre-conditions: a larger, more literate population;
more disposable income; and more free time (for some). But since new novelistic
titles increased four times faster than printed matter in general during the eighteenth
century (even including the flood of pamphlets at the end of the century: see
James Raven, The Business of Books. Booksellers and the English Book Trade 1450–1850,
New Haven, cn 2007, p. 8), we must also explain this different rate of growth:
and that peculiar exaggeration of consumer mentality embodied by distraction and
fashion (and which seems to play a lesser role for drama, poetry, and most other
types of cultural production), seems to be the best explanation we have found so far.
That consumption could play such a large role in the history of the novel depends,
in its turn, on the fact that the suspicion towards reading for pleasure was beginning
to fade, in line with Constant’s idea of the Liberty of the Moderns as ‘the
enjoyment of security in private pleasures’ (Benjamin Constant, Political Writings,
Cambridge 2007, p. 317). Pleasure, by the way, is another blindspot of the theory of
the novel: though we ‘know’, more or less, that the novel was from the very beginning
a form of ‘light reading’ (Thomas Hägg, ‘Orality, literacy, and the “readership”
of the early Greek novel’, in R. Eriksen, ed., Contexts of Pre-Novel Narrative, Berlin
and New York 1994, p. 51), we still work as if reading for pleasure were basically
the same as reading ‘for serious reasons—religious, economic, or social’ (J. Paul
Hunter, Before Novels. The Cultural Contexts of Eighteenth Century English Fiction,
New York and London, 1990, p. 84: one of the few to pose the problem in an interesting
way). This is yet another issue on which specific historical studies are well
ahead of theoretical reflection: the dramatic enlargement of the ancient novelistic
field, for instance, would have been impossible without a shift towards popular,
light, and even vulgar forms of writing. 
the century, new titles increased seven times in France (even though,
in the 1790s, the French had more to do than write novels); fourteen in
Britain; and about thirty in the German territories. Also, by the end of
the eighteenth century print runs had become a little larger, especially
for reprints; many novels that are not included in the standard bibliographies
were published in magazines (some of which had a very wide
audience); the strengthening of family ties encouraged reading aloud at
home (providing the training ground for Dr. Bowdler’s vocation); finally,
and most significantly, the diffusion of lending libraries made novels
circulate much more efficiently than before, eventually leading to the
imposition of the three-decker on writers and publishers alike, so as to
lend each novel to three readers at once. Hard though it is to quantify
these various factors, if all of them combined increased the circulation of
novels between two and three times (a conservative estimate), then the
presence of novels in Western Europe would have gone up between thirty
and sixty times in the course of the eighteenth century. For McKendrick,
the fact that consumption of tea rose fifteenfold in a hundred years is
a great success story of the consumer revolution. Novels, increased
more than tea.
Why? The answer used to be, Because readers did. But the current
consensus—which is slippery, like all that has to do with literacy, but
has been stable for a few decades now—is that between 1700 and 1800,
readers doubled; a little less than that in France, a little more in England,
but that’s the horizon. They doubled; they didn’t increase fifty times.
But, they were reading differently. ‘Extensive’ reading, Rolf Engelsing has
called it: reading a lot more than in the past, avidly, at times passionately,
but probably more often than not also superficially, quickly, even
a little erratically; quite different from the ‘intensive’ reading and rereading
of the same few books—usually devotional ones—that had been
the norm until then.17 And Engelsing’s thesis has often been criticized,
but with novels multiplying so much more quickly than readers, and
readers behaving like the famous John Latimer, of Warwick, who from
mid-January to mid-February 1771 borrowed a volume a day from Clay’s
circulating library,18 it is hard to imagine how the whole process could
have worked without a major increase in—let’s call it distraction.

Let’s call it that, because, even though Engelsing never mentions
Benjamin, extensive reading looks very much like an early version of
that ‘perception in a state of distraction’ described at the end of ‘The
Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’. Distraction
in that essay is Zerstreuung—absent-mindedness, and entertainment: the
perfect mix for novel-reading—and for Benjamin it is the attitude that
becomes necessary at those ‘historical turning points’ when the ‘tasks’
facing ‘the human apparatus of perception’ are so overwhelming that
they can’t be ‘mastered’ by way of concentrated attention:19 and distraction
emerges as the best way to cope with the new situation—to keep up
with those ‘faster-spinning wheels of fashion’ that have so dramatically
widened the market for novels.20
19 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’,
1935, in Selected Writings iii: 1935–1938, Cambridge, ma 2002, p. 119. The passage
returns virtually unchanged in the third version of the essay, in 1939.
20 As I hope is clear, my focus on consumption, fashion and distraction is not meant
to erase capitalism from literary history, but to specify which of its aspects play a
more direct causal role in the novel’s take-off. Unquestionably, capitalist expansion
as such created some key general pre-conditions: a larger, more literate population;
more disposable income; and more free time (for some). But since new novelistic
titles increased four times faster than printed matter in general during the eighteenth
century (even including the flood of pamphlets at the end of the century: see
James Raven, The Business of Books. Booksellers and the English Book Trade 1450–1850,
New Haven, cn 2007, p. 8), we must also explain this different rate of growth:
and that peculiar exaggeration of consumer mentality embodied by distraction and
fashion (and which seems to play a lesser role for drama, poetry, and most other
types of cultural production), seems to be the best explanation we have found so far.
That consumption could play such a large role in the history of the novel depends,
in its turn, on the fact that the suspicion towards reading for pleasure was beginning

moretti: Novel Theory 123
What did the birth of a consumer society mean for the European novel?
More novels, and less attention. Dime novels, not James, setting the tone
of the new way of reading. Jan Fergus, who knows more about lending
libraries’ records than anyone else, calls it ‘desultory’ reading: borrowing
the second volume of Gulliver’s Travels but not the first, or the fourth,
out of five, of The Fool of Quality. And Fergus then hails this as ‘readers’
agency, their power of choice’21—but, frankly, the choice here seems to
be, giving up all consistency, in order to be always somehow in touch
with what the market has to offer. Leaving the tv on all day long, and
watching it every now and then—that’s not agency.

Why was there no rise of the Chinese novel in the eighteenth century—
and no European aesthetic turn? The answers mirror each other: taking
the novel seriously as an aesthetic object slowed down consumption—
while a quickened market for novels discouraged aesthetic concentration.
‘When reading the first chapter, the good reader has already cast his
eyes towards the last’, says a commentary to the Jin Ping Mei (which is
two thousand pages long); ‘when reading the last chapter, he is already
recalling the first’.22 This is what intensive reading is like: the only true
reading is re-reading, or even ‘a series of re-readings’, as some commentators
seem to assume. ‘If you don’t put your pen into action, it cannot
really be considered reading’, as Mao once put it. Study; not one-volumeper-day
consumption. In Europe, only modernism made people study
novels. Had they read with pen and commentary in the eighteenth century,
there would have been no rise of the European novel.

Typically, the great theories of the novel have been theories of modernity,
and my insistence on the market is a particularly brutal version
thereof. But with a complication, suggested by another research project
I’m engaged in at present, on the figure of the bourgeois, in the course
of which I have been often surprised by how limited the diffusion of

bourgeois values seems to have actually been. Capitalism has spread everywhere,
no doubt about that, but the values which—according to Marx,
Weber, Simmel, Sombart, Freud, Schumpeter, Hirschmann . . . —are
supposed to be most congruous with it have not, and this has made me
look at the novel with different eyes: no longer as the ‘natural’ form of
bourgeois modernity, but rather as that through which the pre-modern
imaginary continues to pervade the capitalist world. Whence, adventure.
The anti-type of the spirit of modern capitalism, for The Protestant
Ethic; a slap in the face of realism, as Auerbach saw so clearly in Mimesis.
What is adventure doing in the modern world? Margaret Cohen, from
whom I have learned a lot on this, sees it as a trope of expansion: capitalism
on the offensive, planetary, crossing the oceans. I think she is
right, and would only add that the reason adventure works so well within
this context is that it’s so good at imagining war. Enamoured of physical
strength, which it moralizes as the rescue of the weak from all sorts of
abuses, adventure is the perfect blend of might and right to accompany
capitalist expansions. That’s why Köhler’s Christian warrior has not only
survived in our culture—in novels; films; videogames—not only survived,
but dwarfed any comparable bourgeois figure. Schumpeter put it
crudely and clearly: ‘The bourgeois class . . . needs a master.’23
It needs a master—to help it rule. In finding distortion after distortion
of core bourgeois values, my first reaction was always to wonder
at the loss of class identity that this entailed; which is true, but, from
another perspective, completely irrelevant, because hegemony doesn’t
need purity—it needs plasticity, camouflage, collusion between the old
and the new. Under this different constellation, the novel returns to be
central to our understanding of modernity: not despite, but because of
its pre-modern traits, which are not archaic residues, but functional
articulations of ideological needs. To decipher the geological strata of
consensus in the capitalist world—here is a worthy challenge, for the
history and the theory of the novel.
